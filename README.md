## Why carry out this project ? <a name="introduction"></a>

![Markedet, logo](/static/img/logo2.png)

The idea of creating an e-commerce site is not an end in itself, this idea meets several personal expectations that I will reveal to you as I develop. We must first recall the context, the conditions of germination of this project.

In order to sell yourself on the labor market, it seems essential to demonstrate your know-how and what could be more telling than to carry out a project from scratch. The choice to create an e-commerce site is interesting since it allows me to combine my personal needs with those of potential customers. An entrepreneur, a company sells services or products. A site is an essential means of promoting its activity. According to a study by the Médiamétrie site, France has 53.1 million Internet users, which represents 84.7% of French people. In addition, if a physical store only targets nearby customers, the e-commerce site will make it possible to reach the whole globe.

### Web Scrapping 

For my purposes of illustration and example, the information was scrapped from the [Fashiola.fr](https://www.fashiola.fr/) site.
I make this choice to have data that seems realistic to me and because I didn't want to create it myself, but also because I wanted to test the possibilities with **selenium** and **beautiful soup** .
